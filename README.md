# DiscoWal
## What does it do?
It gives Discord pywal support, aka, it will load up your pywal colorscheme and theme the client with it.
It will also automatically and seamlessly reload the colorscheme when you change it, so you can see all your apps switch colorschemes at once.

## Why the name?
It's a portmanteau of Discord and Pywal

## Installation instructions
- Download the discowal.asar from the releases page on this repo.
- Copy it to `~/.config/discord/*.*.*/modules/discord_desktop_core/`.
- Add `require("./discowal.asar")` to the end of the `index.js` file in the `discord_desktop_core` directory

###### Will probably add an easier way to install, but for now, this is what we've got.
